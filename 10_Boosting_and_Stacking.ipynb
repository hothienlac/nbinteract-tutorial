The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) performed.\n",

This will make the fitting take a little longer. Additionally, boosting models tend to take longer to fit than bagged ones because the decision stumps must be fit successively."
